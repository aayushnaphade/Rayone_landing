        excerpt: "Say goodbye to complex GPU setups. Rayone offers hosted APIs for open-source LLMs like Mistral, LLaMA, and Gemma ‚Äî making AI infrastructure accessible to developers and startups, starting from India.",
        content: ` <p>Running these models locally or self-hosting them demands <strong>expensive GPUs</strong>, <strong>deep infra expertise</strong>, and <strong>significant setup time</strong>. For most developers, startups, and AI teams ‚Äî this slows down innovation and burns budgets before an idea even reaches production.</p>

<h2>That's where Rayone comes in</h2>

<p><strong>Rayone</strong> is a developer-first AI infrastructure platform that provides <strong>hosted APIs</strong> for popular open-source LLMs. We eliminate the complexity of setup and hosting, so you can focus on building, testing, and deploying AI-powered applications faster.</p>

<ul>
    <li>üöÄ Access Mistral, LLaMA, and Gemma instantly via API</li>
    <li>üí∏ No need for personal or cloud GPUs</li>
    <li>üì¶ Fast, scalable inference built on enterprise-grade infra</li>
    <li>üáÆüá≥ First platform focused on AI infra accessibility in India</li>
</ul>

<h2>What problem are we solving?</h2>

<p>Right now, using open-source LLMs at scale is hard. Developers and small teams face:</p>

<ul>
    <li>‚ö†Ô∏è High GPU costs (even on cloud)</li>
    <li>üß† Complex server setup and model tuning</li>
    <li>üïí Wasted time debugging deployments instead of building products</li>

</ul>

<p>Rayone solves all of this with an API-first, developer-friendly approach. Whether you're building a chatbot, research tool, or internal AI assistant ‚Äî you can skip the infrastructure mess and focus on value.</p>
